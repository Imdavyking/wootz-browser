## ⚔️ Kill The Wallet

- 👐 **Open Source**. We have the exact same license as Metamask
- 🎁 **No Extensions**. Just use the damn browser!
- 🙈 **Privacy First**. Not even ads.
- 🔐 **Cryptographic storage**. We use [Flutter Secure Store](https://pub.dev/packages/flutter_secure_storage) for secure storage on mobile. On Android and ios, it uses the native encrypted storage (like secure enclave)

## 📜 License

WootzApp is open-source OSS software. We are not lawyers, hence we have adopted the exact same license that Metamask does. Their reasoning is mentioned here - https://medium.com/metamask/evolving-our-license-for-the-next-wave-of-metamask-users-81b0b494c09a
