<!--Pull Request Template-->

## Description
This project hopes and requests for clean pull request merges. the way we merge is squash and merge. This fundamentally can only work if you **NEVER ISSUE A PULL REQUEST TWICE FROM THE SAME LOCAL BRANCH**. If you create another pull request from same local branch, then the merge will always fail.

solution is simple - **ONE BRANCH PER PULL REQUEST**. We Follow this strictly. if you have created this pull request using your master/main branch, then follow these steps to fix it:
```
# Note: Any changes not committed will be lost.
git branch newbranch      # Create a new branch, saving the desired commits
git checkout master       # checkout master, this is the place you want to go back
git reset --hard HEAD~3   # Move master back by 3 commits (Make sure you know how many commits you need to go back)
git checkout newbranch    # Go to the new branch that still has the desired commits. NOW CREATE A PULL REQUEST
```
